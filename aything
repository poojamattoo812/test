This is in  2nd branch, and its abt mountains.
I saw the mighty mountains
and the tall tress on the both sides of the narrow road
the air was clean and fresh
the sun was nice and warm
I saw it and saw the grandouise creater has bestowed on us
He has spoiled us so much by giving us too much
the rainbow,bent in perfect arch
clouds kising ur nose
what is this, heaven?
