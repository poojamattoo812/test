This is in master branch, and its abt anything.
moon, sea, and feet in sand
the continuous music created by waves
the fluttering of hairs due to the playful wind
u want to become child again
making the sand castles,
playing in the water
the beach holiday gave me more than I sought.



I saw the mighty mountains
and the tall tress on the both sides of the narrow road
the air was clean and fresh
the sun was nice and warm
I saw it and saw the grandouise creater has bestowed on us
He has spoiled us so much by giving us too much
the rainbow,bent in perfect arch
clouds kising ur nose
what is this, heaven?
